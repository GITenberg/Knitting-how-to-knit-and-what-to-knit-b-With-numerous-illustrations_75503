<p>The necessary materials for knitting are either cotton,
worsted, silk or thread, and knitting needles.</p>

<p>Stockings and all knitting worked in rounds require four
knitting needles, three of which are used for holding the
stitches of the work, and the fourth to knit with.</p>

<p>The casting on of stitches forms the beginning of knitting.
It consists of loops formed around a knitting needle. Every
loop will form a stitch. The number of stitches will determine
the width of the object which is to be knitted.</p>

<p>There are five different ways of casting on stitches. For
the casting on of stitches always unroll an end of the cotton
long enough to work the stitches required, as this end is used
in the formation of those stitches.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">No. 1. Position to form the
first Cast on Stitch.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>No. 1.—Illustration No. 1 shows the position of the cotton,
ready to cast on the first stitch. Place the cotton over the thumb
and first finger of the left hand, in such a way as to have the
end of cotton, which must be sufficiently long for the required
number of stitches, fall from the thumb toward the palm of the hand.
Hold this end and the other part of the cotton with the remaining
fingers of the left hand. This same position of the cotton is used
in illustrations 2 and 3. Take the needle with the right hand, place
it over the cotton, between the thumb and the first finger, pass it
under the cotton resting around the thumb, bring it upward; then pass
the needle downward, under the cotton resting on the first finger;
pass this loop through the loop around the thumb, withdraw the thumb
from the loop; pass the thumb under the end of the cotton, toward the
palm of the hand; draw this end in order to close the stitch just
formed.</p>

<p>No. 2—<i>Casting on of Single Stitches.</i>—Begin in the same
manner as described in No. 1, and make 2 stitches. Then take
up on the needle the loop which is around the thumb (see
illustration 2), without withdrawing the thumb, insert the
needle around the cotton marked <i>b</i> in illustration No. 2, from
right to left, and draw it through loop <i>a</i>; close this stitch as
already directed in No. 1, by withdrawing the thumb from
loop <i>a</i> and drawing the end of cotton.</p>

<p>No. 3.—This casting on of stitches requires two needles.
Form the first stitch in same manner as described in No. 1.
Then, with the left hand, hold the needle on which this first
stitch is formed, pass the cotton over the first finger of the left
hand, take a needle with the right hand, and insert the point
into the loop on the left needle, wind the cotton around the
point of the right needle, draw it through the loop, *insert the
point of the left needle into the loop just formed on the right
needle, wind the cotton around the point of the right needle,
draw it through the loop. Repeat from *. See illustration 3.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>No. 4—<i>The Casting on of a New Row of Stitches.</i>—This
casting on of stitches is generally employed in knitting with
worsted, which requires a new casting on of stitches in the
progress of the work. It is done by putting the worsted (see
illustration No. 4) over the thumb of the left hand, holding
the end between the second and third fingers, * take up the
worsted around the thumb and lying toward the palm of the
hand, by inserting the needle from under the worsted in an
upward direction (see illustration No. 4), withdraw the thumb
from the loop, pass the thumb under the end of worsted resting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
in the palm of the hand, and draw it to close the stitch.
Repeat from *.</p>


<p>No. 5.—The casting on of stitches illustrated in cut No. 5
forms a narrow border after the first row has been knitted. In
order to easily knit the first row, the casting on of stitches must
be done on <i>a pair</i> of knitting needles. Unroll an end long
enough for the required number of stitches. Double it. Fold
this doubled end in half, insert the point of the needles into
the fold, place on the first finger of the left hand the long end
of the worsted which is among the short ends. Place the
three short ends over the thumb. Hold all these ends with
the second finger. Take on the needles the ends resting on
the thumb (marked <i>b</i> in illustration), and insert them as shown
in illustration No. 5. Then pass the needles through the loop
on first finger, in the direction of the arrow, and pass this loop
through the loop already formed on the needles, withdraw
the thumb, close the stitch by drawing the three ends, which
is done by passing the thumb under them.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">No. 6. Casting on of Double Stitches.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>No. 6—<i>Double Casting on of Stitches.</i>—The difference between
this method of casting on and the preceding is, that every knot
forms, each time, two loops instead of one, on the needle. The first
knot must be formed in the same manner as described in No. 5. In
order to work the second knot, insert once more the needle into the
loop of three ends which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
rest on the thumb, marked <i>a</i> in illustration No. 6. The arrow,
in same illustration, shows where to insert the needle and the
direction it has to take. This done, insert the needle downward into
loop <i>b</i>, and draw the latter through loop resting on the thumb,
withdraw the thumb and close the knot. Every loop on the needle must
be knitted separately at the first row.</p>

</figure>

<p>Cut No. 7 illustrates plain knitting. This is the stitch generally
used in ordinary knitting. First, cast on the required number of
stitches in one of the ways already described. This done, take in the
left hand the needle on which are the loops, place the thread over
the first finger of the left hand, hold it with the second finger of
the same hand. Take the second needle with the right hand, insert its
point into the stitch, in an upward direction, and throw the thread
around the right hand needle, from right to left. Draw it through the
preceding loop and slip the left hand needle from its loop. Every
loop on the left hand needle is worked in the same manner.</p>

<p>When all the stitches have been worked from the left
hand needle, take that needle in the right hand and continue
to work in same manner.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">No. 8. Purled Knitting.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>To <i>Pearl</i>, <i>Purl</i> or <i>Seam</i>, (meaning the same thing), is done
by holding with the left hand a needle on which a row of
stitches has been cast. Take a needle in the right hand, place
the cotton over the left hand
needle and the first finger of the
left hand, hold the end with the
second finger of the same hand.
Insert the right hand needle
through the loop on the left hand
needle, point right to left, in
such a manner as to have the cotton just under the right hand
needle. Pull this cotton through the loop, withdraw the left
hand needle from the loop, and the purled stitch is formed.</p>

<p><i>How to Repair a Stitch which has been Half Knitted, or
Dropped while Knitting.</i>—In knitting, one ought to be careful
not to drop stitches or to form half stitches. The latter happens
when the thread thrown over the right hand needle has
not been pulled through the loop of the left hand needle. To
remedy this, while working the next round or row, take the
thread which has been thrown over the needle from it, and
pull it through the loop of the stitch. To repair a dropped
stitch, insert the left needle into the stitch, gather all the
threads on the right hand needle and pull them through the
loop of the stitch, one after the other.</p>

<p><i>To Increase.</i>—There are two ways to increase. The first
is, to knit both in the lower part of the stitch and also in the
stitch itself. The second way is to bring the cotton forward
round the end of the right needle, to the front; this forms a
loop on the right needle when the next stitch is knitted, and
this extra loop is the made stitch. It is preferable to increase
after the first manner in plain knitting, as this way of increasing
is not so marked. The second manner is used in fancy
knitting, as it leaves a little opening after the stitch is formed.</p>

<p><i>To Slip a Stitch</i> is to take a stitch off the left needle and
to <i>slip</i> it on to the right needle without knitting.</p>

<p>With any work knitted in rows, it is necessary that the
first stitch of every row be worked as a slipped stitch. If it
is a row of <i>purl</i>, the first stitch must be slipped off as if it
were plain knitting; if it is a row of <i>plain</i> knitting, slip the
first stitch off as if it were purl knitting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span></p>

<p><i>How to Narrow.</i>—The usual way of narrowing is to knit
two stitches together, viz.: put the right needle through two
of the loops on the left needle, and knit them as one stitch.
Another method is to slip a stitch, knit one, and then with
the left needle cast the slipped stitch over the knitted stitch.
When the narrowing is used to give a certain shape to the
work, it is well to employ the first method when narrowing
at the end of the round or row; and the second method when
narrowing at the beginning of it.</p>

<p><i>Casting Off</i> is done as follows: Knit two plain stitches,
with the left needle throw the first stitch over the second,
knit a third stitch, throw the second over the third, knit a
fourth, throw the third over the fourth, and so on until the
last stitch is worked. Pull the cotton through, and a knot is
formed.</p>

<p><i>The Joining of Ends</i> in knitting ought never to be done
by knotting them together. It may be done so that no defect
is visible on the right side of the work, by lapping them three
inches together, and knitting five inches with doubled thread,
leaving the ends on the wrong side of the work. These ends
can then be neatly darned into the wrong side of the work.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lady’s Stocking.</span></h3>

<p>To knit a stocking, attention must be given to the size of
the knitting needles, which ought to correspond with the
number of the material with which the stocking is to be
knitted. It would be difficult to give the exact number of
stitches necessary for any given size of stocking, as there is
always a difference between the knitting of different persons,
since some knit loosely, others very closely. It must be left
to the judgment of the knitter to determine the exact number
of stitches required for the stocking to be knitted.</p>

<p>The following is the method of knitting a lady’s stocking
with No. 300 knitting silk (or any other material of same size),
with needles to correspond.</p>

<p>This stocking is knitted, with a double border, as follows:</p>

<p>Cast on 152 stitches on 3 needles. After having cast
on the last stitch, close the round by knitting the <i>first</i> stitch
cast on.</p>

<p>Knit 16 rounds plain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span></p>

<p>17th Round.—* Slip 1, knit 1, draw the slip stitch over
the knitted stitch, make 1; repeat from * to end of round.</p>

<p>18th to 34th Rounds, inclusive.—Knit plain.</p>

<p>Then fold in half the piece knitted, so that the 17th round
will form the edge of the border.</p>

<p>Pick up on other knitting needles the stitches of the 1st
round, <i>i. e.</i>, the stitches cast on, and knit each of them with
each stitch of the 34th round. This finishes the border. Thus,
the lower edge of the border forms a fancy design of small
scallops. Purl 3 rounds, knit plain 3 rounds, purl 3 rounds.</p>

<p>Then knit plain until the leg of the stocking is twelve
inches long. In the first round of <i>this</i> plain knitting begin
the seam stitch, which ought to correspond with the last and
first stitches cast on. This seam stitch is repeated in every
third round.</p>

<p>After the twelve inches have been knitted, narrow in the
following round 1 stitch on each side of the seam. Knit 8
rounds. Narrow 1 stitch on each side of seam. Knit 7
rounds. Narrow, in manner already described. Knit 6 rounds.
Narrow. Knit 5 rounds. * Narrow. Knit 4 rounds. Repeat
20 times from * until 110 stitches and the 2 seam stitches are
left on the needles. This done, knit plain 30 rounds. The
knitting of the heel now begins. Divide the stitches by
putting on 1 needle the 2 seam stitches and 28 stitches on
each side of them. Thus, there will be upon this needle 58
stitches. Knit this needle, backward and forward, in <i>rows</i>,
making the seam stitches as usual.</p>

<p>When knitting backward, purl <i>all</i> these stitches. When
knitting forward, knit plain all the stitches with exception
of the seam stitch, which must be purled. Always slip the
first knitted stitch. Continue knitting until the flap is 44 rows
long, counting each time across as 1 row.</p>

<p>1st Row.—Now purl from the left hand side the 28
stitches and the 2 seam stitches. Purl 2, knit 2 together,
purl 1. Turn.</p>

<p>2d Row.—Slip 1, 3 plain, 2 purl (seam stitches), 2 plain,
knit 2 together, 1 plain. Turn.</p>

<p>3d Row.—Slip 1, purl 8 (including seam stitches), purl 2
together, purl 1. Turn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span></p>

<p>4th Row.—Slip 1, 4 plain, 2 purl (seam stitches), 3 plain,
knit 2 together, 1 plain. Turn.</p>

<p>5th Row.—Slip 1, purl 10 (seam stitch included), purl 2
together, purl 1. Turn.</p>

<p>Continue to knit in this wise until the remaining stitches
are gradually worked off. Then pick up the side stitches of
this flap, which amount to 36 on each side, and the heel is
formed.</p>

<p>Knit the side stitches of the flap, “making 1” now
and then, so as to make the number of stitches on each side
of the heel amount to 40.</p>

<p>Knit again in rounds. After every 2 rounds purl the
first 2 stitches together, then the last 2 stitches together, of
the heel stitches. Narrow in this manner 12 times. This
done, the number of stitches in the whole round is reduced to
110, <i>i. e.</i>, to the original number before the beginning of the
heel. Knit plain 50 rounds. Commence narrowing of toe as
follows: * knit 2 together, knit 8 plain. Repeat from * to
end of round. Knit 8 rounds plain. * Knit 2 together, knit
7 plain. Repeat from * to end of round. Knit 7 rounds plain.
Knit 2 together, knit 6 plain, knit 2 together, 6 plain, etc., to
end of round.</p>

<p>Knit 6 rounds plain; knit 2 together, 5 plain, 2 together,
5 plain, etc., to end of round.</p>

<p>Knit 5 rounds plain; knit 2 together, 4 plain, 2 together,
4 plain, etc., to end of round.</p>

<p>Knit 4 rounds plain; knit 2 together, 3 plain, 2 together,
3 plain, etc., to end of round.</p>

<p>Knit 3 rounds plain; knit 2 together, 2 plain, 2 together,
2 plain, etc., to end of round.</p>

<p>Knit 2 rounds plain; knit 2 together, 1 plain, 2 together,
1 plain, etc., to end of round.</p>

<p>Knit 1 round plain.</p>

<p>11 stitches now remain. By means of a darning needle,
slip these stitches upon the silk thread with which the knitting
is done. Pass this silk once more through the stitches,
then draw all the stitches together, by pulling the silk thread.
Fasten the thread on the wrong side of the stocking.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Heels of Stockings.</span></h3>

<p>There are three other ways of knitting a stocking-heel, as
illustrations 9, 10 and 11 show. In the directions for knitting
these heels, the same number of stitches is taken as in the
directions for knitting the heel of “lady’s stocking,” <i>i. e.</i>, 28
stitches on each side of the 2 seam stitches, thus leaving 54
for the front of the foot.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp50" id="i_011a" >

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">No. 9. Heel of a Stocking.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><i>Heel No. 9.</i>—Knit 44 rows backward (purling) and forward
(plain). While knitting these rows, make a seam stitch
on each side of the flap. These 2
seams must correspond with the
seam in the center of the flap.
See illustration No. 9.</p>

<p>When the 44 rows have been
knitted, the rounding of the heel
begins. Knit from right hand
side 19 stitches (including the
side seam stitch), knit 2 together,
knit 14 plain (center seam
stitch inclusive), slip 1, knit 1
plain, draw the slip stitch over
the 1 plain. Knit 5 plain. Turn.
Slip 1, purl 25. Turn. Slip 1,
knit 3 plain, knit 2 together, knit 14 plain, slip 1, knit 1 plain,
draw the slip stitch over the 1 plain, knit 5 plain. Turn.
Slip 1, purl 25.</p>

<p>Continue working thus to
the end of cap, alternating
every time each row in same
manner as described. When
the heel is finished, 26 stitches
must remain on the needle.</p>

“make 1” after having knitted them. Repeat this 13 times.</p>

<p>This done, begin the cap of the heel. Put on a special
needle the 12 middle stitches (6 on each side of the seam
stitch), and knit these in <i>rows</i>, forward and backward, until
16 rows have been worked. Narrow at the end of each of
these rows, in knitting the last stitch of the row together with
the first of the remaining stitches on the next needle, then
knit the following stitch and turn.</p>

<p>Knit 16 rows more without narrowing, but at the end of
each row knit 1 of the stitches remaining on the next needle,
and then turn to knit the following row.</p>

<p>When this is done, continue to knit in rows, and narrow
again at the end of each row by knitting the last stitch of
each row together with one of the remaining stitches on the
next needle; then turn and knit the following row. When
the remaining stitches have all been narrowed into the heel,
then begin to knit the foot in rounds.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">No. 16. The Fastening of the New Heel.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Illustrations 15 to 18 show the manner of doing this. To
renew the heel of a stocking, first remove the damaged heel by
cutting along the sides
of the heel, at the end
of the cap and at the
beginning of the heel.
Make even the stitches
belonging to the parts
from which the heel has
just been cut. Take
up these stitches on 5
needles, as illustrated in
cut No. 15. Take up on
2 needles the stitches belonging
to the heel. Then
take up the side stitches
(each side) on 1 needle.
The remaining stitches
belong to the fifth needle,
that is, those which will serve for the joining of the cap
of the heel. Then, with the stitches belonging to the heel,
begin to knit the heel in rows, to
and fro. But, at the end of
every plain row, always knit
the last stitch of the row together
(plain) with the next stitch on
the side needle. The same must
be done at the end of every
purled row, only the last stitch
with the next stitch on the side
needle have to be <i>purled</i> together,
instead of knitted plain.
When the heel has reached the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
required length, then begin to knit the cap of the heel in the
usual way, until the number of stitches corresponds to the
number of stitches of the fifth needle. Join these 2 rows of
stitches together, as illustrated in cut No. 16. This is done by
darning. Take an end of the cotton long enough for this purpose,
and pass it, by means of a darning needle, downward
through the last stitch of the stocking, and through the first
one of the stitches on the fifth needle, or upper row. Then
pass it through the next 2 corresponding stitches of the cap
of the heel. See illustration No. 17, which shows the needle
inserted in the 2 stitches through
which the cotton is to be drawn.
Pass the needle through the next
2 corresponding stitches of the
upper row, in the same direction as
is shown by the arrow in illustration
No. 17. From there * pass it
through the last stitch, already
worked, of the lower row, and through next stitch; then
through the next 2 corresponding stitches of the upper row.
Slip every time the stitch from the knitting needle after having
passed the cotton through them. Repeat from * until all
the stitches of the 2 rows are joined to each other. When
this is done, fasten the cotton
on the wrong side of the stocking
by drawing it through a few
stitches.</p>

</figure>

<p>Illustration No. 17 represents
only a part of the joining,
where the stitches are worked
very loosely, in order that it
might be copied more easily.
Yet, while working, the stitches
of the joining must be drawn to
the same size as the knitted
stitches of the stocking, and in
such a manner that the joining
cannot be detected from the
knitting.</p>

<p>No. 18—<i>How to Re-sole the Foot of a Stocking</i>.—In order<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
to do this, a new heel must first be knitted to the stocking in
the usual way. When this is done, pick up the side stitches
of the heel and begin to knit the sole in <i>rows</i>, to and fro, 1 row
plain, the other purled. At the end of every plain row pick
up the last stitch of the <i>corresponding</i> row of the old sole, and
knit it together, plain, with the last stitch of row just knitted.
The same thing must be done at the end of every purled row,
only purl the 2 stitches together instead of knitting them plain
together. Always slip, plain, the first stitch of every row.</p>

<p>The narrowing of the sole, on both sides, must be done
just before knitting together the last stitch of the row and
the last stitch of the corresponding row of the old sole.</p>

<p>After the new sole has been knitted, turn the stocking on
the wrong side; cut off the old sole along both sides, yet leaving
a strip of 4 stitches in width on each side. Lay each strip
towards the front part of the foot. Unravel them. Smooth
down the ends formed by the unraveling, and fasten them to
the stocking by darning over them lightly, so that this darning
might not be seen on the right side of the stocking. Should
the stocking require a new toe to be knitted on, then unravel
the old one, pick up the stitches and knit a new toe in rounds,
in one of the ways already described in the book.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">How to Darn Stockings.</span></h3>

<p>The darning of a stocking can be done in different ways.
The way most generally adopted is that of cross-work darning,
which looks very well when neatly worked. But the
darning in imitation of the knitted stitch, although more tedious,
is preferable; for, when it is well worked, it cannot be
told from the knitting, except on the wrong side.</p>

<p>No. 19—<i>Cross-Work Darning</i>.—Trim neatly the place
which is to be darned, then work a
foundation of threads length-wise across
the opening, as is shown in illustration
No. 19. This done, begin to darn across

taking up every other thread of the
foundation. In every following row
take up the thread which was not taken
up in the preceding row. See illustration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
No. 19. The darning must be prolonged to a little distance
on each side of the original opening.</p>

</figure>

<p>No. 20—<i>To Imitate the Knitted Stitch in Darning</i>.—This
work requires careful preparation. Loosen the damaged
part, above and below it, in the width, in such a way that
there will remain 2 even rows of perfect
loose stitches. The first and last stitches
of the upper row must correspond to
those of the lower row. Cut the damaged
part through the middle. Fold
each half back upon the inside of the
stocking, where it will have to be
trimmed and fastened. Work a foundation
of threads across the opening,
width-wise, inserting each thread into the second stitch from
the edge of the opening, and making it correspond with every
knitted row. See illustration No. 20.</p>

<p>Then work on this foundation as follows: Place the darning
cotton at the left, pass the darning needle downward
under the lowest of the threads of foundation, and pull gently
the darning cotton, so as to form the half of a stitch. Work
in same manner on the other foundation threads. After making
the half stitch upon the top thread of foundation, pass
the needle through the nearest upper stitch of the stocking.
Turn the work. Place the darning cotton towards the right.
Pass the needle downward, under the top thread of foundation,
draw the cotton lightly, and in this way the first whole
stitch will be formed. Continue to work in same manner on
the foundation threads, until the entire work is done.</p>

<p>Illustrations 21 to 23 show a
different way of imitating the
knitted plain stitch in darning.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">No. 21. Foundation for No. 22.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>To darn after this method, remove
the damaged part and prepare
the opening for foundation
threads in same manner as already
described in preceding number.
Take for foundation thread a cotton
finer than the one with which
the darning stitches have to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
worked. Work the foundation threads <i>length-wise</i> on the
wrong side of the stocking, as shown in illustration No. 21.
This done, turn the stocking on the right side and begin the
darning in imitation of the knitted stitch. Work width-wise,
as follows:</p>

<p>Pass the darning needle through the upper 2 stitches, as
shown in illustration No. 22, then pass it, in the direction of
the arrow, under the next 2 threads
of foundation. Insert the needle
into the last stitch, through which
it has already passed, and pass it
through the stitch next to it. Then
pass it under the next 2 corresponding
threads of foundation.
Continue working in like manner.
When the end of the row is
reached, work in same stitch over
the next 3 stitches of the knitting.</p>

<p>After working over the third stitch, insert the needle downward—along
the part which is not yet darned—into the
upper part of that third stitch, take up the cross bar of the
stitch and draw the cotton through. Then turn the work
from left to right and begin the next row. When the work
has come down to the lower edge of the opening, work the last
row in the usual way; but, instead of passing the needle under
the foundation threads, pass it
through the corresponding stitches
of this edge, as is shown in illustration
No. 23.</p>

<p>When the darning is done,
withdraw carefully the foundation
threads. Trim the damaged part
on the wrong side of the stocking,
and fasten it neatly, as already
stated in directions No. 20.</p>

in equal short bits. Then knit with 11 inch No. 13 needles
as follows:</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">The first row</span> flat plain with coarse cotton or twine.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">The second row</span> one stitch plain; then take a piece
of wool and knit it in with the next stitch, so that one half
of it is at the front and the other half at the back of the
work; then one plain again, and put the half left at the
back round to the front of the work, and continue this
alternately to the end of the row. Knit <span class="allsmcap">ONE ROW PLAIN</span>
again, then <span class="allsmcap">ONE ROW SAME AS THE SECOND</span>, and so on.</p>

<p>The Carpet may be knitted in pieces of any size and
sewn together. If the surface is not quite level cut it even
afterwards.</p>

<p>The best results are obtained by using Oriental Wool,
Smyrna Cotton and designs manufactured expressly for the
purpose and lately introduced into this market by Messrs. H.
Taylor &amp; Co., of Philadelphia. Rugs knitted from these
materials are as beautiful and serviceable as the real Oriental
Carpets, and, if well done, cannot be distinguished from
them.</p>
